## About This App

cFinder allows people who lived and travelled together to keep track of their numerous friends who dispersed during lockdown. 

It uses a React.js front-end to allow efficient stateful components to update based on user search. It runs with Express.js and a NoSQL database. 

Coming Soon: add a photo feature through AWS S3.
